# Wine-ratings
#This script analyzes the data set of 130k wine reviews posted by user "zynicide" on Kaggle.com
#This project is intended as a first foray into show-casing my R capabilities, focusing on 
#basic data analysis using style conventions from Hadley Wickham's tidyverse. I will be producing
#this code as both a basic R script and R Markdown file.
